# Revenue Analysis, company "AdventureWorks"

The data I had:
1. AdventureWorks.salesorderheader (with salesreasonID)
2. AdventureWorks.salesreason
3. AdventureWorks.employee (with contact data)
4. AdventureWorks.SalesTerritory


I've been tasked to populate the 'Overview' sheet with analytical insight:
1. Business would like to see the monthly sales trend.
2. They would also like to evaluate online vs non-online orders.
It would be nice for business to have an overview of:
1. The delivery performance trend (orderdate & Shipdate lag)
2. Top salesperson by sales, by volume.
3. Top countries.
4. Top sales reasons
